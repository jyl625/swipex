SwipeX is a real-time trading platform that provides meal swipes exchange services for college students who are unable to use up their meal swipes and those who look to enjoy the delicious food in university cafeterias.

It very important to know what to expect before we take on our first bites in the student cafeteria. Historical prices are presented in line graphs with various meal types, locations, and dates, so you know when to pass or raise the bets! Clicking on a specific posting meal swipe would lead you to a chatroom where you could start a direct conversation with the seller, and that is where the bargain begins! Once you and the seller reach agreement on the price, SwipeX also provides a meetup service that you and the seller could decide when and where to the seller could swipe you in the cafeteria.

Do you miss the old school days when you enjoyed good quality buffet with your friends from college? Or do you have too many meal swipes left before the semester ends? Let's not waste on the great opportunity and hop on SwipeX!
